# Video Chat Test

This is a Rails 6 app for testing different options to implement a video chat functionality.

Several students of the current Web Dev batches at [Le Wagon Montreal](https://lewagon.com "Visit us!") have this type of feature in mind for their final projects, so I am investigating in advance the different possibilities.

So far, I've tried [Daily](https://www.daily.co/)'s solution, which proved surprisingly simple to implement.

Next up is [Agora](https://www.agora.io/en/) ðŸ•µ

This is also the first time I use [dotenv-webpack](https://github.com/mrsteele/dotenv-webpack#description) in order to use `ENV` variables in `JS`.
